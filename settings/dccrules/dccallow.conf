/* Example of a possible semi-secure /DCCALLOW configuration written by Syzop.

 *
 * Actually nothing is *100% secure*... there could still be
 * bugs in the software itself (think: a winamp bug that can
 * be exploited via an mp3, or: a wmplayer bug that can be
 * exploited via a specially crafted .wmv, etc..).
 * If you are really that paranoid you could just remove
 * all 'allow dcc'-blocks and prompt the user for EVERY file ;).
 *
 * Still, I think this file is a good tradeoff between userfriendlyness
 * and security. Note that when you try to only DENY specific
 * file type (exe, com, etc) you are *guaranteed* to miss ones
 * (like: did you know .r17 gets treated as a rar archive?
 *  and that an exe can be disguished as .cmd which is executable
 *  on nt/w2k/xp?)
