Unreal supports the following auth-types: crypt, md5, sha1, ripemd-160. 
This command would give you a result, which is the hashed version of that password. 
When you have the result from the command, enter the password in the oper block like this:

  password <result> { <auth-type>; };

  EXAMPLE:

    If my password was "password" and I wanted it to be hashed with sha1, I would type:
   /quote mkpasswd sha1 password

    Which would give me:
    *** Authentication phrase (method=sha1, para=password) is: $6L/ybC6i$S8/+1SAx96FcbatLyHzoYJHxxCw=

    Then I would put it in my oper block as:
    password "$6L/ybC6i$S8/+1SAx96FcbatLyHzoYJHxxCw=" { sha1; };

    I would then be able to oper:
     /oper login password 

    NOTE: It will be different every time you run it! Don't worry, this is because the hashes are salted 
          so they are different each time. It is still the same password.
