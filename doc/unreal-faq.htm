        <blockquote> The IP 0.0.0.0 = all interfaces. This error is
          because you are on a shell, or your curent user does not have
          permissions to bind to all interfaces.<br>
          <br>
          To fix this, specify the IP that the shell provided you with

          contact the administrator. If this is your own server, and you
          dont have the permissions as this user, simply use the IP of
          the device you want connections to come in on.<br>

          Example:<br>
          <tt>listen 1.2.3.4:6667;</tt><br>
          1.2.3.4 will be the IP of the interface you wish to use.<br>

          If you still get this error, try running "<tt>netstat -anlp |

          is giving you problems) to see if anything is listening on

        <p><b><u>Where are G/K/Z:Lines and spamfilters stored?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> G/K/Z:Lines are stored in memory, and not in any
          file. The only bans stored in a file are the ones you specify
          yourself in Unreal's configuration. This means that when
          Unreal is restarted, all bans and spamfilters added using
          /spamfilter are lost. To preserve such data, is to link Unreal
          to a network, where the other servers will store global bans
          and spamfilters and send them back when the server is
          restarted. Another way would be to get the tlk_export and
          tkl_import modules, and have that information saved manually
          when the server is restarted (note: these modules would not be
          able to store spamfilters). </blockquote>

          I have come up with ways to do it simply with both mIRC and
          XChat.<br>
          <br>
          For mIRC, press ALT+R to open up the Remote Scripts Editor,
          and enter the following line:
          <pre>raw 223:*:{ gline - $+ $3 }</pre>
          For XChat, you may use the following TCL script:
          <pre>on 223 rmgline {
  set gline [split $_rest " "]
  /gline -[lindex $gline 1]
}</pre>
          Once you have entered the script, simply type /gline, and the
          script will remove the glines as it receives the list from the
          server. Additionally, you may use "/stats g +m &lt;mask&gt;"
          to only remove glines matching a certain mask. You may get
          disconnected while doing this, just reconnect and do it again.<br>
          <br>
          When done, BE SURE TO REMOVE OR COMMENT THE SCRIPT! Otherwise,
          it will cause issues in the future. </blockquote>

          <pre>raw 229:*:{ if ($2 === F) { spamfilter del $3 $4 - - $10- } }</pre>
          For XChat, you may use the following TCL script (I think this
          is correct. If it is not, please let me know):
          <pre>on 229 rmspamfilter {
  set spamfilter [split $_rest " "]
  /spamfilter del [lrange $spamfilter 1 2] - - [lrange $spamfilter 8 end]
}</pre>
          Once you have entered the script, simply type /spamfilter
          (with no parameters), and the script will remove the
          spamfilters as it receives the list from the server. You may
          get disconnected while doing this, just reconnect and do it
          again.<br>

          the modules m_tkl_export and m_tkl_import to export and import
          your G/K/Z:Lines to file and restore them, or you can
          configure another Unreal to link just for the purpose of
          saving them. Keep in mind your services will not save your
          G/K/Z:Lines unless they were set through the services to begin

            instructions for 3.2.9 and older versions may be found by
            reading doc/compiling_win32.txt.</strong><br>
          Before you compile on Windows, you will need the latest
          version of Microsoft Visual Studio. You can download a <a
            href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/">free version of
            MSVC++ Express</a> from Microsoft, which is more than enough
          to compile UnrealIRCd.<br>

            COMPILE</b>
          <ol>
            <li>Download the Unreal tarball (source), and extract all
              the files to a location on your computer.</li>
            <li>Download <a href="/donate?dl=devlite">this package of
                libraries</a> and extract the dev folder to where you
              extracted the UnrealIRCd source.</li>
            <li>Open the Visual Studio Command Prompt and navigate to
              the dev folder inside the UnrealIRCd folder.</li>
            <li>Run <tt>DoItForMe.bat</tt> by typing it into the
              command prompt.</li>
            <li>When the compile has finished, you will have a new
              folder called bin in the UnrealIRCd folder. This folder
              will contain all the binaries and DLLs needed to run

        <blockquote> It seems with every release there is either some
          antivirus or firewall software blocking cloak.dll from being
          installed or accessed on a Windows installation. This is also
          an increasing problem due to the trend of antivirus makers
          hiding actions from their users, so you don't get a warning.<br>
          <br>
          In order to fix this without uninstalling your antivirus
          software, you must add an exception in the antivirus for the
          UnrealIRCd program folder. This varies depending on the
          specific antivirus and version you run, so you should consult
          your antivirus help. Once that is complete uninstall and
          reinstall UnrealIRCd (back up your configuration first), and
          you should be able to access all the files.<br>

        <a name="pingfreq"></a>&nbsp;<br>
        <p><b><u>Why do my users constantly get "Ping timeouts"?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> This usually happens on low-bandwidth servers. A
          low-bandwidth server is usually run either from your home,
          office, or on a crappy shell. To fix this problem, you need to
          increase the pingfreq in your class block for client
          connections. A good number to increase this value if 30. By
          increasing this value, you are telling Unreal to send the
          PING's further apart.<br>
          <br>
          In order to set a good pingfreq, you need to understand that a
          ping on IRC is not the same as the ping you can do from a
          terminal or command prompt. A ping on IRC is a server or
          client sending the PING command over the IRC connection and
          wait for a matching PONG. When someone pings out on IRC it
          means they have failed to reply to 2 PINGs with a PONG.<br>
          <br>
          You will never be able to eliminate ALL ping timeouts, because
          a good number of them happen due to the way information is
          sent over the internet. Most modems/routers provided by ISPs
          close connections with little or no activity, and the PING
          command is there to attempt to stop this from happening. Each
          device that has this "feature" varies from model to model on
          when they will close the connection.<br>
          <br>
          If your pingfreq is set too low, laggy connections won't have
          sufficient time to reply, and if your pingfreq is too high
          you'll be exceeding the time it takes for a connection to be
          considered "idle". It is up to you to find a good medium that
          produces the fewest ping timeouts based on your clients,
          server bandwidth, and number of users on your network. We
          recommend setting it between 60 and 120 (in 15 or 30 second
          incriments). </blockquote>

          Please keep in mind that running a server of any kind requires
          basic networking knowledge (such as routers, firewalls, and

          your server, it means you <u><b>DO NOT</b></u> have the
          knowledge required to run a server. Before going any further
          with your IRCd, I do suggest you take the time to learn basic
          networking. If you do not learn these things now, you will
          only run into more trouble in the future! With most free
          software there are not helpful people like myself or Unreal's

        <p><b><u>How do I add encrypted passwords to oper blocks?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> The way to do this would be to use Unreal's
          MKPASSWD command. This command can be used while connected as
          /mkpasswd or on *nix as ./unreal mkpasswd. The syntax for this
          command is:
          <pre>mkpasswd &lt;auth-type&gt; &lt;password&gt;</pre>
          Unreal supports the following auth-types: crypt, md5, sha1,
          ripemd-160. This command would give you a result, which is the
          hashed version of that password. When you have the result from
          the command, enter the password in the oper block like this:
          <pre>password &lt;result&gt; { &lt;auth-type&gt;; };</pre>
          EXAMPLE:
          <blockquote> If my password was "password" and I wanted it to
            be hashed with sha1, I would type:<br>
            <tt>/mkpassword sha1 password</tt><br>
            <br>
            Which would give me:<br>
            *** Authentication phrase (method=sha1, para=password) is:
            $6L/ybC6i$S8/+1SAx96FcbatLyHzoYJHxxCw=<br>
            <br>
            Then I would put it in my oper block as:<br>
            <tt>password "$6L/ybC6i$S8/+1SAx96FcbatLyHzoYJHxxCw=" {
              sha1; };</tt><br>
            <br>
            I would then be able to oper:<br>
            <tt>/oper login password</tt> </blockquote>
          NOTE: It will be different every time you run it! Don't worry,
          this is because the hashes are salted so they are different
          each time. It is still the same password. </blockquote>

        <a name="meshlink"></a>&nbsp;<br>
        <p><b><u>Is it possible to do mesh linking?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> As of writing this, mesh linking is currently not
          available in any IRCd. Unreal may not support it, but Unreal
          does have excellent linking features to allow server
          administrators to configure redundant linking that would be
          put into affect as soon as a server splits from the network.<br>
          <br>
          To set up your server, all you need to do is follow these
          instructions:
          <ol>
            <li>Add a link block for every server in each server's conf.
              If you compiled Unreal for Remote Includes, you should be
              able to put the link information into 1 conf file and have
              the servers share it.</li>
            <li>Enable the Auto Connect option in every link block.</li>
            <li><strong>On Unreal 3.2.8.1 and older</strong>, you will
              need to add Deny Link blocks for every server in your
              network. This will stop the servers from trying to link
              when the server is already in the network. The syntax you
              will need to use is:<br>
              <tt>deny link { mask "servername"; rule
                connected("servername"); type "auto"; };</tt><br>
              Both servernames should be the same as the server in the
              link block. For example, if you have a link block for
              server1.example.com, you would set server1.example.com in
              both servername fields in that Deny Link Block. Remember,
              you need one Deny Link block for every link block on every
              server! (this is one reason why using remote includes
              would be best)</li>
            <li>As an added option if you have a host to spare, it would
              make your network more solid to do the same with the
              services. Unfortunately, because services developers lack
              the ability of thinking outside the box, most services do
              not support SSL and will exit when the link goes down.
              Solutions to the SSL issue would be to use sTunnel and
              configure a different port for each server on your
              network, then have the server list in your services go to
              the different sTunnel ports. To get around the services
              exiting when link fails, you should use crontab and a
              check script.</li>

          Such configuration would look like:

        <p><b><u>Why is the use of Mibbit not allowed in the Unreal
              support channel?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> Currently we do not allow people using Mibbit or
          Mibbit-like IRC clients to get support. Mibbit hides the IP
          addresses of users, which makes it impossible for UnrealHelper
          to track users. We fully understand there are "workarounds"
          and full support on UnrealIRCd networks for mibbit. Here are a
          few reasons why Mibbit is not supported for IRC support:
          <ol>
            <li>Modifying UnrealHelper to detect and use the IP encoded
              into the ident will not only be time-consuming, but very
              inefficient making UnrealHelper slower than it already is.</li>
            <li>UnrealHelper has no way of turning the decoded mibbit IP
              into a proper cloaked host/IP used to track users and to
              match mibbit users with existing users using direct
              connections.</li>
            <li>People wishing to run an IRC server should really be
              using a direct connection to IRC (in other words, using a
              real client).</li>

        <p><b><u>Why is there a quiz to get support?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> We require people to take a quiz for a few reasons.
          The quiz is there to gather information about your set up for
          us, as well as qualify you for support. We understand most
          help channels will help anyone who happens to stumble in, but
          we're here to provide a higher level of support to the users.
          In order to provide a higher level of support to our users, we
          require they have read the docs, FAQ, and have a basic
          understanding of their operating system and networking. Since
          these are required, we can then offer full solutions to
          problems without the "RTFM" and "Google it" parts. </blockquote>
        <a name="uhelper"></a>&nbsp;<br>
        <p><b><u>Is the quiz open source?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> To put it simply: no.<br>
          <br>
          The reason UnrealHelper is not open source is primarily
          because UnrealHelper is custom coded specifically to
          #Unreal-Support's needs. Another reason UnrealHelper is not
          open source is because it contains sensitive information such
          as passwords.<br>
          <br>
          The quiz and bot are basically 2 separate parts sharing the
          same SQL database. The database has 4 tables, one for each
          type of questions (windows, *nix, general IRC, and network).
          Each table has 6 fields, one for the question, 4 for each of
          the answer options, and 1 for the single-letter correct
          answer. The website takes the information entered into the
          quiz and generates the answer, starting with !, the letter of
          your OS selection (n or w), then the 6 quesion/answer pairs in
          &lt;question number&gt; + "-" + &lt;answer letter&gt;, and
          lastly adding 1 for a modified IRCd and 0 for vanilla. The
          final quiz answer looks like !n1-a2-b3-c4-d5-a6-b0<br>
          <br>
          The bot then takes that answer and compares it to the SQL
          database. It starts first by splitting up the answer string
          into sensible sections, something like: n 1-a 2-b 3-c 4-d 5-a
          6-b 0. It checks the first two questions depending on the OS
          letter (n or w), then compares the question number and given
          answer with the question number and correct answer fields in
          the database. It then moves to the next two answer pairs to
          check general IRC questions, then finally the last 2 pairs for
          network questions. It counts each correct answer, and weights
          the final decision based on the 'modified' flag.<br>
          <br>
          With the given information in the answer string, it then knows
          whether it should voice the user submitting or deny the user
          access. To remember users who passed, it uses a simple address
          list based on the 3rd address mask (*!*ident@*.some.isp.com).
          To prevent answer sharing, a list of submitted answers is
          periodically audited and shared answers are deactivated. The
          same answer may not be given twice in a row. </blockquote>

        <p><b><u>Will I ever need to retake the quiz?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> You will need to take the quiz under the following
          conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>Your user@host changes.</li>
            <li>You leave the channel and don't return for 28 days.</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <a name="avoice"></a>&nbsp;<br>
        <p><b><u>Can I be added to the VOP list?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> Voicing users in #Unreal-Support is entirely left
          to UnrealHelper. The reason for this is the VOP list cannot be
          restricted to addresses which makes the possibility for
          passwords to be shared and accounts to be abused. In the event
          UnrealHelper is not online, the channel is unmoderated and
          anyone may speak.<br>
          <br>
          To add to that, the quiz is not made to be difficult and if
          you need to continue taking the quiz it should not take any
          longer than 30 seconds to go through the questions and get a
          new code. </blockquote>

          This is all explained in Unreal's documentation, please read
          the docs and learn how to use your server. If you can't or
          don't want to do that, you shouldn't be running an IRCd. </blockquote>
        <a name="getnicks"></a>&nbsp;<br>
        <p><b><u>How do I see who connected from a specific IP?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> Unreal does not store this information in such a
          way that it can be retrieved without modules (as of writing,
          no module exists to do this). The only methods in existance
          that are usable to server admins are: your client's
          scrollback/logs, and Unreal's logs. It would be extremely
          simple to grep through either of the logs for the IP you're
          looking up. If you didn't have any logs on the server with the
          connect flag, then you probably should enable that now! </blockquote>

        <p><b><u>How do I keep opers from attacking higher opers?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>If you think you have an oper that is going to kill or
              ban another oper, he/she should not have an O:Line.</li>
            <li>If there is an oper who is abusing their power on
              another server in the network, and that server's admin is
              refusing to talk to that oper or remove his/her O:Line,
              that server does not belong on the network. Delink it.</li>
            <li>If you don't own the network and the other admins are
              refusing to do anything about the abusive oper, find a
              better network to link to.</li>
            <li>Also note, that if the oper in question is on another
              server, you are required to run such modules that "fix
              this" on every server on the network. If the other admins
              are refusing to cooperate, then you can't use a module
              anyway.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There you have it, plain and simple solutions. It all comes

        <a name="hideidle"></a>&nbsp;<br>
        <p><b><u>How do I hide my idle time?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> There is no way to remove the idle time from WHOIS
          without modifying the source. As mentioned many times,
          modifying the source voids your privilege to receive support
          (the general rule is "if you can edit it, you can fix it when
          you break it").<br>
          <br>
          However, if you do not wish to have your idle time displayed
          in WHOIS, you can always put in a false idle time by creating
          timed scripts to reset your idle. The idle time is reset each
          time you send a message, or CTCP. All you need to do is use
          one of these methods to create that. Pretty simple stuff!<br>
          <br>
          Note that if you are hiding your idle time because you do not
          wish to be disturbed is not the proper thing to do. There are
          things already in place to tell people to leave you alone as
          it is. You have AWAY, umode +D (provided by privdeaf), and +R.
          Also, the ability to hide your idle time will likely NOT be
          added to Unreal as a feature - there's not much use for such a
          feature. </blockquote>

              name in your services configuration file all match.</li>
            <li>Remember that set::services-server is cAsE-sEnSiTiVe,
              and will not work if you have a different case.</li>
            <li>Make sure your services are online and connected to your
              server.</li>

        <p><b><u>How do I hide/remove the server information on connect?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> Short answer: Not possible. Some clients do have
          the option to hide this information, but it may not be hidden
          or removed for everyone and still be a functioning IRC server.<br>
          <br>
          Long answer: the information shown when a client connects is
          the server telling the client what is and is not allowed on
          the network. This contains information such as how ops are
          displayed in channels, what channel types are allowed, what
          commands and modes the server has available, the server name,
          the network name, the list goes on. Without this information
          your IRC client will not know what to do on this server, and
          will not be able to send the proper commands for IRC to work.

        <p><b><u>How do I upgrade UnrealIRCd?</u></b></p>
        <blockquote> Upgrading UnrealIRCd to the newest version can be
          easily done while minimizing downtime for users.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Before upgrading UnrealIRCd:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Check the release notes to see if there are any changes
              that need to be made to your configuration. Be sure to
              read ALL release notes for every version between your
              version and the latest.</li>
            <li>Make any desired or required changes to your
              configuration.</li>
            <li>Copy all the configuration files you use to a different
              location (any *.conf files, SSL certificates, etc).</li>
            <li>Download the latest version of UnrealIRCd for your
              system.</li>
            <li><strong>Read through the upgrade instructions for your
                system BEFORE doing them.</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <strong>Upgrading *NIX:</strong><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Extract the source to your home directory, as if you
              were installing UnrealIRCd for the first time.</li>
            <li>Gather the source files for any custom modules you may
              be using.</li>
            <li>Run <tt>./Config</tt> and answer the questions. If you
              have UnrealIRCd installed to its own directory (like
              /home/you/unreal), be sure to specify the SAME directory
              here. Otherwise, the default or a different directory may
              be used.</li>
            <li>Run <tt>make</tt> to compile UnrealIRCd.</li>
            <li>Compile any custom modules you may be using.</li>
            <li>Run <tt>make install</tt> if you specified a different
              path in ./Config.</li>
            <li>Veify that your configuration files and custom modules
              are present in the UnrealIRCd directory, copy them if
              needed.</li>
            <li>Restart UnrealIRCd</li>
          </ol>
          <strong>Upgrading on Windows:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Gather or compile any custom modules you may be running.</li>
            <li>Shut down UnrealIRCd.</li>
            <li>Run the installer and select the same installation
              location.</li>
            <li>Veify that your configuration files are in the
              UnrealIRCd folder, copy them if needed.</li>
            <li>Start UnrealIRCd.</li>
          </ol>
