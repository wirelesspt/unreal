Instructions:
As root user in you server create a new user in the box:

 # useradd -m -s /bin/bash ircd
 # passwd ircd
 # Password: (Enter the password for ircd)
 # Re-enter password: (Re-enter the password to verify)

Change from root to the ircd user:
 # su ircd
 $ cd /home/ircd/
 
As the ircd user enter the new user's directory, download unrealircd
templates that wirelesspt and nixbits use and then from the official  
unrealircd repository download the latest ircd source code from 3.2.x
branch at https://www.unrealircd.org/download

Download the templates:
 $ git clone https://github.com/wirelesspt/unreal.git

Download the sources:
 $ wget --no-check-certificate https://www.unrealircd.org/downloads/Unreal3.2.10.4.tar.gz

Extract the source files:
 $ tar -zxvf Unreal3.2.10.4.tar.gz
 $ cd Unreal3.2.10.4/

Compile the sources:
 $ ./Config; make; make install

When asked "What directory are all the server configuration files in" change to:
 /home/ircd/unreal/

When asked "What is the path to the ircd binary including the name of the binary?" change to:
 /home/ircd/unreal/src/ircd

What should the default permissions for your configuration files be?
 [0600]
 
Do you want to support SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connections?
 [Yes]

Do you want to enable IPv6 support?
 [say yes if your server supports it]

Do you want to enable ziplinks support? 
 [Yes]

Do you want to enable remote includes? 
 [say yes if you know what you are doing]

Do you want to enable prefixes for chanadmin and chanowner?
 [Yes]

What listen() backlog value do you wish to use?

How far back do you want to keep the nickname history?
 [2000]

What is the maximum sendq length you wish to have?
 [3000000]

How many buffer pools would you like?
 [18]

How many file descriptors (or sockets) can the IRCd use?
 [1024]

During the compilation process; you will be asked to create ssl certificates
Do not forget to create them according to your liking

If you need to create ssl certificates later; you can use the scripts 
generate-ssl.sh & generate-tls.sh inside settings/sslcerts/

Once the ircd compilation ends you must compile the extra modules:

Copy the modules to the ircd setup sources:
 $ cp ~/unreal/modules_extra/* src/modules/

Copy the executable module compile script to the root of unreal sources:
 $ cp ~/unreal/compile_modules_extra.sh .

Compile the modules:
 $ ./compile_modules_extra.sh

After the modules are complied; they need to be added to unreal binary location:
 $ cp src/modules/*.so  ~/unreal/modules/

Your ircd should be able to start without a problem now:
 $ cd ~/ircd/unreal/
 $ ./unreal start 

Add a crontab that checks unrealircd and starts it at boot using provided script:
 $ crontab setup_crontab

(if you get any errors make sure you are in the crontab group)

Finally ajust the templates to your preferences and restart unreal 

ATTENTION ! You may want to change the following files:

 settings/me/me.conf
 settings/admin.admin.conf
 settings/network/network.conf
 settings/motd/ircd.motd.pt 
 settings/motd/ircd.motd.ssl.pt 
 settings/motd/ircd.motd.en 
 settings/motd/ircd.motd.ssl.en

You will need to change this files if you want to link to another hub or leaf:

 settings/links/wirelesspt.conf
 settings/links/nixbits.conf

WARNING ! Due to security reasons YOU MUST CHANGE this files:

 settings/vhost/vhost.conf         <-- with password of your preference
 settings/network/cloak-keys.conf  <-- create 3 different long random 'passwords'    
 settings/drpass/drpass.conf       <-- create very secret passwords here

For wiki support you can visit https://wirelesspt.net/wiki/ircd and our forums

If you find any errors with this tutorial, please report it to the git maintainer

No support will be given for pre modified unrealircd, templates or modules.
