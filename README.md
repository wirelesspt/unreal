Unreal 3.2.* Ircd Custom Installation
===============================

The git repository where you are getting this unrealircd configuration 
templates was created to facilitate the instalation and fast configuration 
of a new ircd hub to join the network wirelesspt.net and provide a new
national and international irc chat global network.

These templates are organized to be able to be used as or with ircd
remote include functionality. Please note that this is an advanced 
instalation and usage template method and your ircd must be compiled
with zlib & openssl.
Additionally curl for remote includes is advised unless you use sshfs
to mount the remote include network drive that contains remote configs

For instalation details with these templates and custom modules
check doc/install.txt which MUST BE followed.

To know how to link hubs check doc/linking_hubs.txt & criptography is mandatory.
For information about the extra modules check doc/modules_info.txt

Additionally and inside ~/unreal/doc/ you will find the official unreal32docs
which will provide you all the information to undestand how things work.
